# FDF
- The FDF project (Fils de Fer) is part of the 42 School curriculum, where the goal is to create a 3D wireframe viewer in C. 
- It offers an in-depth exploration of graphics programming and low-level computation in C, providing a solid foundation for further work in computer graphics and software development.
  
# GOAL
- Parsing a file containing 3D coordinates, projecting them onto a 2D screen, and rendering them using basic graphical functions.
- Efficiently handle transformations, rotations, and scaling of the 3D data, all while optimizing the code for performance.
